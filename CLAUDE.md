# EntityDB Platform

> [!IMPORTANT]
> EntityDB is a high-performance temporal database where every tag is timestamped with nanosecond precision. All data is stored in a custom binary format (EBF) with Write-Ahead Logging for durability and concurrent access support.

> [!CRITICAL]
> **Authentication Architecture Change (v2.29.0+)**
> User credentials are now stored directly in the user entity's content field as `salt|bcrypt_hash`.
> This eliminates separate credential entities and relationships. Users with credentials have the `has:credentials` tag.
> NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY - all users must be recreated.

## Development Guidelines

### Key Principles
1. **Everything is an Entity**: No special tables or structures
2. **Binary Storage**: All data in custom binary format
3. **Tag-Based RBAC**: Permissions are entity tags
4. **Clean Codebase**: Remove unused code immediately

### Building
```bash
cd /opt/entitydb/src
make                # Build server
make install        # Install scripts
```

### Running
```bash
./bin/entitydbd.sh start   # Start server (auto-creates admin/admin if needed)
./bin/entitydbd.sh status  # Check status
./bin/entitydbd.sh stop    # Stop server
```

> **Important**: SSL must be enabled (ENTITYDB_USE_SSL=true) for proper CORS functionality. Without SSL, browsers may block API requests from web applications due to mixed content policies.

### Default Admin User
The server automatically creates a default admin user if none exists:
- Username: configurable via `ENTITYDB_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` (default: `admin`)
- Password: configurable via `ENTITYDB_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default: `admin`)
- Email: configurable via `ENTITYDB_DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` (default: `admin@entitydb.local`)

⚠️ **Security**: Change these defaults in production environments using environment variables or CLI flags.

## Tag Namespaces

- `type:` - Entity type (user, issue, workspace, relationship)
- `id:` - Unique identifiers
- `status:` - Entity state
- `rbac:` - Roles/permissions (FULLY ENFORCED)
  - `rbac:role:admin` - Admin role
  - `rbac:role:user` - Regular user role
  - `rbac:perm:*` - All permissions
  - `rbac:perm:entity:*` - All entity permissions
  - `rbac:perm:entity:view` - View entities
  - etc.
- `conf:` - Configuration
- `feat:` - Feature flags

## What's NOT Implemented

- Rate limiting
- Audit logging  
- Aggregation queries (beyond sorting/filtering)

> **Note**: All temporal features (history, as-of, diff, changes) are now FULLY IMPLEMENTED as of v2.32.0! EntityDB delivers complete temporal database functionality with nanosecond precision timestamps.
