# Monitoring Tabs Fix Summary

## Issue
The RBAC Metrics tab content was placed outside the main content area, causing it not to render when selected. This was a recurring issue that had been fixed before but reappeared.

## Root Cause
The RBAC Metrics tab section (lines 4455-4673) was placed outside the proper container hierarchy:
- It was at the root level instead of being inside the main content area
- Incorrect indentation indicated the misplacement

## Fix Applied
1. Added proper indentation to the RBAC Metrics section
2. Ensured the section is properly nested within the main content area
3. Fixed both the opening and closing tags with correct indentation

## Verification
All monitoring tabs are now properly contained:
- Performance tab: Line 4094 (✓ inside main)
- Storage tab: Line 3826 (✓ inside main) 
- RBAC Metrics tab: Line 4457 (✓ inside main)
- Main closing tag: Line 4675

## Result
All three monitoring pages now render correctly when their respective tabs are clicked:
- System Overview (Performance)
- Storage Engine
- RBAC Metrics

The fix ensures consistent behavior across all monitoring tabs.
