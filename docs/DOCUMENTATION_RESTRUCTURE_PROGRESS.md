- [ ] Create category-specific README.md files
- [ ] Build cross-reference system
- [ ] Implement breadcrumb navigation

### Phase 7: Cross-Reference Validation  
- [ ] Validate all internal links after reorganization
- [ ] Update relative paths for moved content
- [ ] Test all code examples and API references
- [ ] Verify external link accuracy

### Phase 8: Final Quality Assurance
- [ ] Comprehensive proofreading and editing
- [ ] Consistency review across all categories
- [ ] User journey testing for each persona
- [ ] Final technical accuracy verification
