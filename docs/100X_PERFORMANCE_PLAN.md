# 100X Performance Optimization Plan for EntityDB

Current baseline: ~189ms average query time
Target: ~2ms average query time (100x improvement)

## 1. In-Memory Database Mode
- Keep entire database in memory
- Only write to disk for durability
- Memory-mapped files for instant access

## 2. Advanced Indexing
- B+Tree indexes for range queries
- Hash indexes for exact matches
- Bloom filters for existence checks
- Composite indexes for multi-tag queries
- Reverse indexes for relationship queries

## 3. Parallel Processing
- Multi-threaded query execution
- Concurrent read operations
- SIMD operations for data processing
- GPU acceleration for large operations

## 4. Query Optimization
- Query plan caching
- Cost-based optimizer
- Query result materialization
- Adaptive query execution

## 5. Data Layout Optimization
- Column-oriented storage for analytics
- Data compression (Snappy/LZ4)
- Hot/cold data separation
- Denormalization for common queries

## 6. Caching Layer
- Multi-level cache hierarchy
- Distributed cache (Redis)
- Query result caching
- Precomputed aggregations

## 7. Binary Format Improvements
- More efficient serialization (FlatBuffers/Cap'n Proto)
- Zero-copy reads
- Aligned memory access
- Custom allocator

## 8. Network Optimizations
- HTTP/2 or gRPC
- Connection pooling
- Request batching
- Binary protocol

## 9. Asynchronous Operations
- Async I/O
- Write-ahead logging optimizations
- Background index maintenance
- Lazy loading

## 10. Hardware Optimization
- NUMA awareness
- CPU affinity
- Huge pages
- Direct I/O
