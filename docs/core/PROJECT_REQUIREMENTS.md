# EntityDB Project Requirements

This document captures the comprehensive set of requirements that guided the development of EntityDB, documenting how the system evolved based on our discussions and implementations.

## Core Conceptual Requirements

### Entity Model

- **Pure Entity Design**
  - Everything must be represented as an entity
  - Each entity has a unique ID, tags, and optional content
  - No special tables or schema variations
  - Universal entity structure regardless of entity "type"

- **Tag-Based Architecture**
  - All metadata stored as tags on entities
  - Tags follow namespace:value format (e.g., type:user, status:active)
  - Tags can be added, removed, and queried efficiently
  - No predefined schema limitations

- **Content Flexibility**
  - Support any type of content (binary or text)
  - No size limitations via autochunking
  - Content can be empty (metadata-only entities)
  - Content is treated as opaque binary data

### Temporal Requirements

- **Nanosecond Precision**
  - All changes tracked with nanosecond timestamps
  - Timestamps attached to tags rather than entities
  - Format: TIMESTAMP|tag for all stored tags

- **Time Travel Queries**
  - Query entity state at any point in time
  - View entity history with timeline of changes
  - Compare entity state between timepoints
  - Track who changed what and when

- **Transparent Timestamp Handling**
  - Hidden from API users by default
  - Optional inclusion with include_timestamps parameter
  - All query functions handle temporal tags transparently

### Storage Requirements

- **Custom Binary Format**
  - Efficient storage of entities, tags, and content
  - Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for durability
  - Journal-based append-only format for historic data
  - Support for large content via chunking

- **Memory-Mapped Access**
  - Zero-copy reads for efficient data access
  - OS-level caching to optimize performance
  - Minimal RAM requirements even with large datasets

- **Autochunking**
  - Automatically split large files across entities
  - Default chunk size of 4MB
  - Transparent recombination when retrieving content
  - No practical size limits for content

## Security Requirements

- **Role-Based Access Control**
  - Tag-based permission system
  - Fine-grained access control to entities
  - Support for roles and hierarchical permissions
  - RBAC enforcement at API level

- **Secure Authentication**
  - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
  - Token-based authentication
  - Session management with expiration
  - Protection against common attacks

- **SSL Support**
  - HTTPS for all communications
  - SSL-only mode option
  - Automatic certificate generation for development
  - Custom certificate support for production

## API Requirements

- **RESTful Interface**
  - JSON request/response format
  - Standard HTTP methods
  - Resource-based URL structure
  - Complete API coverage for all operations

- **Entity Operations**
  - Create, read, update, delete operations
  - Tag management (add/remove tags)
  - Content upload and download
  - Batch operations for efficiency

- **Query Capabilities**
  - Query by tags and tag patterns
  - Search content
  - Advanced filtering and sorting
  - Pagination for large result sets

- **Relationship Management**
  - Create and query entity relationships
  - Relationship types and directionality
  - Efficient traversal of relationships
  - Relationship permissions via RBAC

## Performance Requirements

- **Efficient Indexing**
  - B-tree timeline for temporal data
  - Skip-list indexes for range queries
  - Bloom filters for rapid negative lookups
  - Namespace indexes for tag categories

- **Optimized Query Performance**
  - Sub-100ms response time for typical queries
  - Support for millions of entities
  - Efficient memory usage with large datasets
  - Parallel query execution where possible

- **Concurrency Support**
  - Multiple simultaneous readers
  - Write operations with proper locking
  - Transaction support via WAL
  - Recovery from crashes without data loss

## Configuration Requirements

- **Hierarchical Configuration**
  - Command-line flags
  - Environment variables
  - Configuration files
  - Sensible defaults

- **Runtime Configuration**
  - Log level adjustment
  - Feature flags
  - Dynamic configuration entities
  - No restart required for most settings

## UI and Documentation

- **Administrative Interface**
  - Dashboard for system statistics
  - User management
  - Entity browsing and management
  - Configuration management

- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - API documentation with examples
  - Architecture overviews
  - Deployment guides
  - Performance tuning recommendations
