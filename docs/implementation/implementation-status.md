# EntityDB Implementation Status

**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Version**: v2.16.0  
**Status**: Production-ready with enhanced data integrity

## Current Implementation

### Core Architecture ✅
- Pure entity model with tags and content
- Binary storage format (EBF) with WAL
- Single server binary (main.go)
- REST API for all operations
- Temporal queries with nanosecond precision

### Storage Layer ✅
- Custom binary format implementation
- Write-Ahead Logging for durability
- Concurrent access support with locks
- Granular entity-level locking
- Transaction support

### API Endpoints ✅
- Entity CRUD operations
- Temporal queries (as-of, history, diff)
- Entity relationships
- Basic authentication
- User management
- Dashboard statistics
- Configuration management

### Authentication ✅
- Secure session management with TTL
- Bcrypt password hashing with salt
- RBAC fully enforced
- Session refresh capability
- Automatic session cleanup
- Relationship-based security model

### Web UI ✅
- Alpine.js dashboard
- Entity browser and editor
- Real-time updates
- Authentication integration

### Data Integrity ✅
- SHA256 checksums on all operations
- Operation tracking with unique IDs
- Transaction management with two-phase commit
- Recovery system (WAL, cache, backups)
- Real-time integrity monitoring
- Automatic corruption recovery

### Monitoring & Observability ✅
- Health checks with system metrics
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- RBAC metrics dashboard
- System metrics dashboard
- Real-time session monitoring
- Authentication analytics

### What's NOT Implemented ❌
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Advanced aggregation queries
- Distributed transactions
- Point-in-time recovery

## Recent Cleanup (v2.3.0)

Removed:
- 89 deprecated files
- 20,000+ lines of code
- All SQLite code
- Unused middleware
- Legacy API handlers
- Migration scripts

Added:
- Binary persistence improvements
- Query builder pattern
- Entity-based config/flags
- Cleaned documentation

## Performance Characteristics

- Fast reads with binary format
- Concurrent access support
- Write-ahead logging
- In-memory indexes
- Nanosecond timestamp precision

## Production Readiness

Ready for:
- Development environments
- Small to medium deployments
- Read-heavy workloads

Not ready for:
- High-security environments (no password hashing)
- Large-scale deployments (no clustering)
- Complex query requirements
