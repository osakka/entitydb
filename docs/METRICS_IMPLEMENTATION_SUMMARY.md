# EntityDB Metrics Implementation Summary

## Current Status (v2.24.0)

### ✅ Working Metrics

1. **Query Metrics**
   - `query_execution_time_ms` - Successfully tracking query execution times
   - Shows average values like 1977ms for entity list queries
   - Properly aggregated and displayed in UI

2. **HTTP Request Metrics**
   - `http_request_duration_ms` - Tracking HTTP request durations
   - `http_requests_total` - Total count of HTTP requests
   - `http_response_size_bytes` - Response sizes by endpoint

3. **Storage Write Metrics**
   - `storage_write_duration_ms` - Write operation durations
   - Shows values like 2577.6ms for write operations
   - Properly tracked during entity creation and updates

4. **System Metrics**
   - Memory metrics (alloc, heap, GC stats)
   - Database metrics (entity counts, tag statistics)
   - WAL metrics (size, checkpoint success)

5. **RBAC Metrics**
   - Authentication events (successful/failed logins)
   - Active session counts
   - Success rates

### ✅ Newly Fixed Metrics

6. **Error Metrics**
   - `error_count` - Now tracking errors by component, type, and severity
   - Integrated into entity handlers and auth handlers
   - Shows error counts like 6 total errors from various sources
   - Properly aggregated with sum aggregation

### ❌ Metrics Still Showing 0 (Need Fix)

1. **Storage Read Metrics**
   - `storage_read_duration_ms` - Always shows 0
   - TrackRead method exists but needs recursion prevention
   - Storage metrics are being created but not aggregated properly

2. **Cache Metrics**
   - `query_cache_hits` - Placeholder, always 0
   - `query_cache_miss` - Placeholder, always 0
   - Cache implementation exists but metrics not integrated

3. **Index Metrics**
   - `index_lookups` - Placeholder, always 0

## Implementation Details

### Query Metrics Fix
- Added query metrics tracking to `ListEntities` function
- Properly categorizes queries by type (tag_filter, wildcard, search, namespace, list_all)
- Uses global `queryMetrics` collector initialized in main.go

### Error Metrics Implementation
- Added `TrackHTTPError` calls to entity handlers (GetEntity, CreateEntity, ListEntities)
- Added error tracking to authentication failures in auth handler
- Error metrics are categorized by component, type (not_found, invalid_input, internal_error), and severity
- Successfully creates error metric entities that are aggregated

### Aggregation System
- Metrics aggregator runs every 30 seconds
- Aggregates labeled metrics (with dimensions) into simple metrics for UI
- Properly handles temporal tags with nanosecond timestamps
- 24-hour aggregation window for better coverage

### UI Integration
- System metrics endpoint (`/api/v1/system/metrics`) provides aggregated values
- Performance tab displays real metrics instead of mock data
- Values update dynamically from aggregated metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Storage Read Metrics**
   - Ensure `storageMetrics` is properly initialized in all repository types
   - Add logging to verify TrackRead is being called
   - Test with different repository configurations

2. **Implement Error Tracking**
   - Integrate error metrics collector with actual error paths
   - Track errors by category (not_found, timeout, permission_denied, etc.)

3. **Cache Metrics Integration**
   - Connect cache hit/miss tracking to actual cache operations
   - May require cache implementation updates

4. **Remove Placeholders**
   - Replace placeholder values with actual implementations
   - Or remove metrics that won't be implemented

## Testing

Test scripts available:
- `/opt/entitydb/tests/test_query_metrics.sh` - Tests query metrics
- `/opt/entitydb/tests/test_storage_read_metrics.sh` - Tests storage read metrics
- `/opt/entitydb/tests/test_error_metrics.sh` - Tests error tracking and metrics
- `/opt/entitydb/share/htdocs/test-all-metrics.html` - Visual metrics dashboard

## Known Issues

1. **System Metrics Endpoint Performance**: The `/api/v1/system/metrics` endpoint can timeout on large databases due to calculating database statistics. This affects the UI display but metrics are still being collected and aggregated properly.

2. **Storage Read Metrics**: Need to implement recursion prevention similar to storage write metrics to avoid infinite loops when tracking metrics for metric entities.
