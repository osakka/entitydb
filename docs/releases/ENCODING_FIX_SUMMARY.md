# EntityDB Content Encoding Fix Summary

## Overview

In EntityDB v2.13.0, we've implemented a comprehensive fix for critical content encoding issues that affected both string and JSON content storage. The previous implementation had several issues that could lead to data corruption, double-encoding, and inconsistent content handling.

## Problems Addressed

1. **Double Encoding**: JSON content was being double-encoded, making it difficult to retrieve the original content
2. **Inconsistent Content Types**: No differentiation between string and structured content
3. **Missing MIME Type Information**: No way to determine the original content type
4. **Base64 Encoding Issues**: Inconsistent application of base64 encoding
5. **No Content Type Detection**: The system didn't auto-detect content types
6. **Binary Data Corruption**: Risk of data corruption with binary content

## Solution Implemented

The new implementation includes:

1. **MIME Type Detection**:
   - Auto-detection of content types (string vs JSON)
   - Content type tagging with `content:type:*` tags (e.g., `content:type:text/plain`, `content:type:application/json`)
   - Storage of MIME type information for accurate content retrieval

2. **Standardized Base64 Encoding**:
   - Consistent application of base64 encoding for all content
   - Single round of encoding to prevent data corruption
   - Properly decoding content on retrieval

3. **Content Type Preservation**:
   - JSON objects stored with proper typing
   - String content preserved as strings
   - Binary content properly handled

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing entities continue to work
   - Legacy content formats are properly handled
   - No data migration required

## Implementation Details

1. **Entity Creation**:
   - Detect content type (string vs JSON)
   - Add appropriate `content:type:*` tag
   - Apply base64 encoding once
   - Store content in the correct format

2. **Entity Retrieval**:
   - Retrieve base64-encoded content
   - Check `content:type:*` tags for proper decoding
   - Decode content once
   - Return properly formatted content

3. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive test scripts for both string and JSON content
   - Verification of proper encoding/decoding
   - Confirmation of backward compatibility

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents data corruption and ensures content is stored correctly
- **Consistency**: All content handled in a consistent manner
- **Type Safety**: Proper MIME type detection and preservation
- **Performance**: Reduced overhead by avoiding double encoding/decoding
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing data without migration

## Future Improvements

- Further MIME type support for additional content types
- Enhanced binary content handling
- Content validation based on MIME type
- Content transformation capabilities

## Testing

The fix has been thoroughly tested with:
- Simple string content
- Complex JSON objects
- Nested JSON structures
- Legacy entity formats
- High-volume entity creation and retrieval

All tests confirm the proper functioning of the new content encoding system.
