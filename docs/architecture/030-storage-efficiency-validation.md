**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-20  
**Deciders**: EntityDB Core Team  
**Technical Lead**: Claude Reasoning Model  
**Git Commits**: Storage testing implementation (current session)  

## Context

EntityDB's unified `.edb` file format required comprehensive validation to ensure storage efficiency, performance characteristics, and file format consistency meet production requirements. The unified format represented a significant architectural decision that needed empirical validation against design goals.

### Validation Requirements

1. **Storage Efficiency**: Validate entity data vs overhead ratios
2. **Performance Characteristics**: Measure read/write latencies and throughput
3. **Format Consistency**: Ensure unified format usage throughout system
4. **Concurrent Access**: Validate multi-user performance characteristics
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Confirm simplified backup and deployment benefits

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive storage testing framework to validate unified format architecture and establish performance baselines.**

### Technical Implementation

1. **Storage Analysis Framework**
   - Comprehensive file format validation and integrity checking
   - Storage breakdown analysis (entity data, indexes, WAL, metadata)
   - Efficiency ratio calculations and optimization recommendations
   - File handle usage and operational efficiency measurement

2. **Performance Benchmark Suite**
   - Multi-threaded concurrent access testing (10 goroutines, 500 operations)
   - Random access pattern validation (4KB, 64KB, 1MB reads)
   - Sustained throughput testing (5-second duration tests)
   - File operation latency measurement (open, close, seek operations)

3. **Format Consistency Validation**
   - Legacy file detection and cleanup verification
   - Unified format usage compliance across all environments
   - File system efficiency and resource utilization analysis
