**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-20  
**Deciders**: EntityDB Core Team  
**Technical Lead**: Claude Reasoning Model  
**Git Commits**: `b5dfd94`, `8551e06`, `0becd52`  

## Context

EntityDB required a comprehensive technical documentation audit to achieve world-class standards with meticulous attention to accuracy, organization, and industry compliance. The existing documentation, while functional, needed systematic improvement to serve as an industry model for technical writing excellence.

### Problems Addressed

1. **Documentation Accuracy**: Need for 100% technical accuracy verification against codebase
2. **Professional Organization**: Required industry-standard taxonomy and information architecture
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Elimination of content duplication across documentation library
4. **IEEE Compliance**: Implementation of IEEE 1063-2001 professional documentation standards
5. **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure aligned with user journeys and expertise levels

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive documentation excellence framework with systematic accuracy verification and professional standards compliance.**

### Technical Implementation

1. **Documentation Accuracy Framework**
   - Automated verification procedures for technical accuracy
   - Cross-reference validation between documentation and implementation
   - Comprehensive accuracy scoring and quality metrics
   - Systematic maintenance guidelines and governance processes

2. **Professional Taxonomy Standards**
   - IEEE 1063-2001 compliant naming conventions and organizational taxonomy
   - User journey-aligned information architecture with progressive disclosure
   - Industry-standard directory organization and file naming patterns
   - Professional metadata and tagging systems

3. **Master Documentation Architecture**
   - Complete restructuring of 169 total files (99 active, 70 archived)
   - Authoritative project README.md as comprehensive technical showcase
   - Documentation hub README.md as master navigation with progressive disclosure
   - Comprehensive cross-reference system and topic discovery optimization
