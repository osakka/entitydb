# Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal**: Establish modern CI/CD foundation  
**Effort**: 40 engineering hours  
**Risk**: Low  

## Overview

This phase establishes the fundamental automation that every modern software project needs. Without these basics, everything else is exponentially harder.

## Deliverables

### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Automated testing on all PRs
- [ ] Security scanning with gosec
- [ ] Code quality checks with golangci-lint
- [ ] Automatic builds

### 2. Container Support
- [ ] Production-ready Dockerfile
- [ ] Multi-stage builds for optimal size
- [ ] Health checks and proper signal handling
- [ ] Non-root execution

### 3. Release Automation
- [ ] Automated binary builds for multiple platforms
- [ ] GitHub release creation with changelog
- [ ] Semantic versioning enforcement

## Implementation Files

All files in this directory are ready to copy into the project root:

- `ci.yml` → `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `release.yml` → `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `Dockerfile` → `Dockerfile`
- `Makefile.additions` → Add to existing `Makefile`

## Success Criteria

By the end of this phase:

- ✅ Every PR automatically tested
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities caught before merge
- ✅ Container images built on every commit
- ✅ Releases created with one GitHub action

## Estimated Timeline

- **Day 1-2**: Implement GitHub Actions CI
- **Day 3-4**: Create and test Dockerfile
- **Day 5-6**: Setup release automation
- **Day 7**: Testing and documentation

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, move to [Phase 2: Developer Experience](../phase2/) to make development delightful for the team.
