# EntityDB Security Implementation Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the security components in the EntityDB platform. Use this checklist to ensure that all security components are properly integrated and functioning.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review existing code for security gaps
- [ ] Understand the entity-based architecture
- [ ] Identify critical security touchpoints
- [ ] Plan implementation approach
- [ ] Create backup of current system

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Secure Password Handling

- [ ] Add bcrypt package dependency
- [ ] Implement password hashing function
- [ ] Implement password validation function
- [ ] Update user creation to use password hashing
- [ ] Update authentication to use password validation
- [ ] Verify no plaintext passwords in storage
- [ ] Run `test_secure_password.sh` to verify implementation

### 2. RBAC Implementation

- [ ] Define role hierarchy (admin, user, readonly)
- [ ] Implement role storage in user entities (tags)
- [ ] Add permission checking to entity API endpoints
- [ ] Implement admin-only operation protection
- [ ] Add read-only user restrictions
- [ ] Ensure consistent RBAC enforcement
- [ ] Run `test_rbac_entity.sh` to verify implementation

### 3. Audit Logging

- [ ] Create audit logger implementation
- [ ] Implement structured log format
- [ ] Add logging for authentication events
- [ ] Add logging for access control events
- [ ] Add logging for entity operations
- [ ] Implement log rotation
- [ ] Create log storage directory
- [ ] Run `test_audit_logging.sh` to verify implementation

### 4. Input Validation

- [ ] Implement validation framework
- [ ] Define validation patterns
- [ ] Add validation to entity API endpoints
- [ ] Add validation to relationship API endpoints
- [ ] Add validation to authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement clear error responses
- [ ] Run `test_input_validation.sh` to verify implementation

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Ensure all components work together
- [ ] Update API handlers to use all security components
- [ ] Integrate validation before authentication
- [ ] Integrate authentication before authorization
- [ ] Add audit logging for all security events
- [ ] Run combined tests with `run_security_tests.sh`

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Review all implementation code
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Ensure validation covers all input fields
- [ ] Verify RBAC protects all sensitive operations
- [ ] Confirm audit logs capture all security events
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility if needed

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] Document secure password implementation
- [ ] Document RBAC implementation
- [ ] Document audit logging implementation
- [ ] Document input validation implementation
- [ ] Create security architecture overview
- [ ] Update API documentation with security details
- [ ] Create user guide for security features

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run individual component tests
- [ ] Run combined security test script
- [ ] Test with admin user
- [ ] Test with regular user
- [ ] Test with read-only user
- [ ] Test with invalid credentials
- [ ] Test with malformed input

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy updated code
- [ ] Verify all security components working in production
- [ ] Monitor for security events
- [ ] Create alerts for suspicious activity
- [ ] Plan security update process
