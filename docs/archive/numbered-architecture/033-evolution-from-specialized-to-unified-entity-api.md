# ADR-033: Evolution from Specialized APIs to Unified Entity Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-05-11  
**Authors**: EntityDB Architecture Team  
**Related**: ADR-005 (Application-Agnostic Design), ADR-012 (Binary Repository Unification)

## Context

This ADR documents the architectural evolution from specialized domain-specific APIs (workspaces, issues, agents) to a unified entity-based architecture. The old repository reveals EntityDB originally implemented separate API endpoints for different object types before consolidating to the current pure entity model.

## Historical Background

### Original Specialized API Architecture
The old EntityDB implementation featured separate API endpoints for different domain objects:

```
Legacy API Structure:
- /api/v1/direct/workspace/*  # Workspace-specific operations
- /api/v1/direct/issue/*      # Issue-specific operations  
- /api/v1/direct/agent/*      # Agent-specific operations
```

### Specialized Handlers and Models
Analysis of the old repository shows:
- Separate handler files for each object type
- Domain-specific data models (Issue, Workspace, Agent)
- Specialized database tables for each entity type
- Custom validation logic per object type
- Fragmented permission systems

### Problems with Specialized Architecture

#### 1. API Fragmentation
From `IMPORTANT_ARCHITECTURE_TRANSITION.md`:
- Multiple API surfaces to maintain
- Inconsistent patterns across object types
- Complex client implementations
- Difficulty adding new object types

#### 2. Database Schema Complexity
The old repository shows:
- Separate tables for each object type
- Complex foreign key relationships
- Schema migrations for each new object type
- Difficult relationship modeling across types

#### 3. Code Duplication
Evidence in old codebase:
- Duplicated CRUD operations
- Repeated validation patterns
- Multiple similar handlers
- Inconsistent error handling

## Decision Rationale

### Architectural Vision
The old repository's `entity_based_architecture.md` outlines the vision:

> "The entity-based architecture is a flexible, extensible approach to managing data in the EntityDB platform. It introduces a generic Entity model that can represent various domain objects (issues, workspaces, agents, etc.) in a unified way."

### Consolidation Strategy
From the old repository's transition plan:

**Phase 1: Dual-Write Mode**
- Operations on specialized objects also create/update corresponding entities
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Allow gradual migration of client code

**Phase 2: Unified API Implementation**
- Implement unified entity API
- Create compatibility adapters for legacy endpoints
- Redirect legacy endpoints with deprecation notices

**Phase 3: Pure Entity Architecture**
- Complete migration to entity-only operations
- Remove specialized handlers and models
- Implement "zero tolerance policy" for specialized endpoints

### Pure Entity Model Benefits

#### 1. Unified Data Model
```go
// From old repository entity model
type Entity struct {
    ID      string                 // Unique identifier
    Tags    []string              // Classification and metadata
    Content []ContentItem         // Typed content with timestamps
}
```

#### 2. Relationship Simplification
```go
// Unified relationship model
type EntityRelationship struct {
    SourceID         string  // Source entity ID
    RelationshipType string  // Type of relationship
    TargetID         string  // Target entity ID
    Metadata         JSON    // Additional relationship data
}
```

#### 3. Tag-Based Classification
Instead of separate tables, entities use tags:
- `type:workspace` for workspace entities
- `type:issue` for issue entities
- `type:agent` for agent entities
- `status:active` for state management
- `priority:high` for metadata

## Implementation Strategy

### Migration Approach
The old repository documents a careful migration strategy:

#### 1. Entity-Issue Adapter Layer
From `entity_issue_adapter.go`:
- Compatibility layer presenting entities through legacy Issue API
- Transparent conversion between entity and specialized formats
- Maintains client compatibility during transition

#### 2. Dual-Write Implementation
- Updates to specialized objects automatically create/update entities
- Ensures data consistency during migration period
- Allows rollback capability if needed

#### 3. API Redirection with Deprecation
From the old repository's transition notes:
```
Legacy API Redirection (With Deprecation Notices):
- /api/v1/direct/workspace/* - Redirected to entity API with type=workspace
- /api/v1/direct/issue/* - Redirected to entity API with type=issue
```

### Zero Tolerance Policy
The old repository's `IMPORTANT_ARCHITECTURE_TRANSITION.md` establishes:

> "Zero tolerance policy for specialized endpoints and direct database access:
> - All operations go through the unified entity API
> - Legacy endpoints redirect to the entity API with deprecation notices
> - No specialized handlers for different object types"

## Technical Implementation

### Unified API Surface
Current implementation provides single API for all operations:
```
POST   /api/v1/entities/create       # Create any entity type
GET    /api/v1/entities/list         # List entities with tag filtering
GET    /api/v1/entities/get          # Get entity by ID
PUT    /api/v1/entities/update       # Update any entity type
DELETE /api/v1/entities/delete       # Delete any entity type
```

### Tag-Based Filtering
Unified querying across all entity types:
```bash
# Get all workspaces
GET /api/v1/entities/list?tag=type:workspace

# Get high-priority issues
GET /api/v1/entities/list?tag=type:issue&tag=priority:high

# Get active agents in workspace
GET /api/v1/entities/list?tag=type:agent&tag=workspace:ws_123&tag=status:active
```

### Relationship Unification
Single relationship API handles all connection types:
```bash
# Issue dependencies
POST /api/v1/entity-relationships
{
  "source_id": "issue_123",
  "relationship_type": "depends_on", 
  "target_id": "issue_456"
}

# Workspace membership
POST /api/v1/entity-relationships
{
  "source_id": "user_789",
  "relationship_type": "member_of",
  "target_id": "workspace_123"
}
```
