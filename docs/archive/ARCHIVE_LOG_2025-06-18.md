## Rationale

This archival maintains the EntityDB documentation principle of keeping active directories focused on user-facing, current documentation while preserving historical work for reference. The archived files represent:

1. **Completed Implementation Work** - Action plans and reports for completed features
2. **Resolved Issues** - Bug tracking and specific problem resolution documents  
3. **Historical Analysis** - Performance reports and implementation analysis from specific versions
4. **Internal Planning** - Audit documents and internal planning materials

## Archive Organization

```
docs/archive/
├── internal-audits/          # Audit documents and action plans
├── implementation-reports/   # Completed implementation reports  
├── resolved-issues/          # Resolved bug tracking and testing plans
└── [existing archive structure remains unchanged]
```

This organization allows for easy retrieval of historical information while maintaining clean active documentation directories focused on current user and developer needs.
