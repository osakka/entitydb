# Phase 2: Developer Experience (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal**: Make development absolutely delightful  
**Effort**: 60 engineering hours  
**Risk**: Low  

## Overview

This phase transforms the developer experience from "complex setup requiring tribal knowledge" to "productive in 10 minutes with zero prior context." We focus on eliminating friction and automating the mundane.

## Problems We're Solving

### Current Pain Points
1. **Complex Setup**: Multiple manual steps to get development environment running
2. **Slow Feedback**: Manual testing and building slows development cycles
3. **Inconsistent Environment**: "Works on my machine" problems
4. **Poor Tooling Integration**: Manual linting, formatting, and quality checks

### After Phase 2
1. **One-Command Setup**: `./dev-setup.sh` gets anyone productive immediately
2. **Hot Reload**: Changes reflected instantly without manual rebuilds
3. **Consistent Environment**: Docker-based development with reproducible setups
4. **Integrated Quality**: Automatic formatting, linting, and pre-commit hooks

## Deliverables

### 1. One-Command Developer Setup
- [ ] `dev-setup.sh` script that handles everything
- [ ] Automatic dependency installation
- [ ] Development configuration creation
- [ ] Pre-commit hook setup

### 2. Development Container Support
- [ ] `.devcontainer` for VS Code and GitHub Codespaces
- [ ] All development tools pre-installed
- [ ] Consistent environment across all developers

### 3. Hot Reload Development Server
- [ ] Automatic rebuild and restart on code changes
- [ ] Live reload for static assets
- [ ] Fast feedback cycles (< 2 seconds)

### 4. Enhanced Development Tooling
- [ ] Integrated linting and formatting
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement
- [ ] IDE configuration and extensions
- [ ] Debug configuration for popular IDEs

### 5. Developer Documentation
- [ ] Quick start guide (< 5 minutes to productivity)
- [ ] Development workflow documentation
- [ ] Debugging and troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Common tasks automation

## Implementation Files

All files in this directory are ready to use:

- `dev-setup.sh` → Project root
- `devcontainer/` → `.devcontainer/`
- `vscode/` → `.vscode/`
- `air.toml` → `.air.toml` (hot reload configuration)
- `Makefile.dev` → Add to existing `Makefile`

## Success Criteria

By the end of this phase:

- ✅ New developer productive in under 10 minutes
- ✅ Code changes reflected in < 2 seconds
- ✅ All quality checks automated and integrated
- ✅ Zero "works on my machine" issues
- ✅ Comprehensive IDE integration

## Technical Implementation

### Hot Reload with Air
We'll use [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for live reloading:
- Watches Go files for changes
- Automatically rebuilds and restarts server
- Preserves logs and state where possible
- Configurable file patterns and ignore rules

### Development Container
Full development environment in a container:
- All Go tools and dependencies
- EntityDB build tools
- Debug capabilities
- Consistent across all platforms

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automated quality enforcement:
- Go formatting with `gofmt`
- Import organization with `goimports`
- Linting with `golangci-lint`
- Security scanning with `gosec`
- Test execution

## Estimated Timeline

- **Day 1**: Create dev-setup.sh and test across platforms
- **Day 2**: Implement hot reload with Air configuration
- **Day 3**: Create development container and VS Code integration
- **Day 4**: Set up pre-commit hooks and quality automation
- **Day 5**: IDE configuration and debugging setup
- **Day 6**: Developer documentation and guides
- **Day 7**: Testing with fresh developers and refinement

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 2, move to [Phase 3: Production Readiness](../phase3/) to prepare for enterprise deployment.
