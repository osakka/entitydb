## üèóÔ∏è Key Architectural Principles

### Entity-Centric Design
- Everything is an entity with tags and temporal history
- No specialized tables or complex relational schemas
- Unified operations across all data types
- Flexible schema evolution through tag additions

### Temporal-First Approach
- All data changes captured with nanosecond timestamps
- Time-travel queries as first-class operations
- Audit trail built into core architecture
- Efficient temporal indexing and querying

### Tag-Based Everything
- Classification through hierarchical tag namespaces
- Permissions implemented as tags
- Flexible metadata without schema changes
- Powerful query capabilities through tag combinations

### Performance Optimization
- Binary format (EBF) for efficient storage
- Memory-mapped files with OS-managed caching
- Write-Ahead Logging for durability
- Concurrent access with sharded locking

## üîó Quick Navigation

- **Implementation Guides**: [Developer Guides](../60-developer-guides/) - How to extend EntityDB
- **API Details**: [API Reference](../30-api-reference/) - Technical API specifications
- **Deployment**: [Deployment](../70-deployment/) - Production architecture patterns
- **Performance**: [Admin Guides](../50-admin-guides/) - Operational optimization

## üìä Architecture Metrics

### Design Constraints
- **Single-node deployment**: Current limitation, distributed system planned
- **Binary format storage**: Custom EBF format optimized for entity operations
- **Memory-mapped I/O**: Leverages OS page cache for performance
- **Go runtime**: Single-binary deployment with embedded web interface

### Performance Characteristics
- **Entity Operations**: Sub-millisecond for typical operations
- **Temporal Queries**: Optimized indexing enables fast time-travel
- **Tag Searches**: O(1) lookups with intelligent caching
- **Concurrent Access**: Sharded locking prevents contention
