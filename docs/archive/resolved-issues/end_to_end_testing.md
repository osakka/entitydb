# EntityDB End-to-End Audit Plan

> **Version**: v2.32.0-dev | **Created**: 2025-06-15 | **Status**: EXECUTION READY

## Overview

Comprehensive end-to-end audit to validate EntityDB functionality, performance, and reliability. This plan systematically tests all major components and user workflows.

## Audit Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Health Checks
- [x] Service status and process health
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration validation
- [ ] Port accessibility and firewall
- [ ] Log file analysis
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Database file integrity

### Phase 2: Authentication & Security
- [ ] Default admin user access
- [ ] Password change functionality
- [ ] Session management and expiration
- [ ] RBAC permission enforcement
- [ ] JWT token validation
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts

### Phase 3: Core Entity Operations
- [ ] Entity creation (various content types)
- [ ] Entity retrieval and listing
- [ ] Entity updates and tag modifications
- [ ] Entity deletion
- [ ] Large content handling (autochunking)
- [ ] Binary content upload/download

### Phase 4: Temporal Features
- [ ] Tag timestamp precision
- [ ] Time-travel queries (as-of)
- [ ] Entity history retrieval
- [ ] Temporal diff operations
- [ ] Timeline consistency

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Entity relationships
- [ ] Complex queries and filtering
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Metrics collection and retrieval
- [ ] System health monitoring

### Phase 6: Dashboard UI
- [ ] Dashboard accessibility
- [ ] Entity browser functionality
- [ ] User management interface
- [ ] Performance metrics display
- [ ] Real-time updates

### Phase 7: Performance & Stress
- [ ] Concurrent user sessions
- [ ] Large dataset operations
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Response time validation
- [ ] WAL checkpoint behavior

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. Automated Testing Commands
Each test includes:
- **Pre-conditions**: What must be true before test
- **Action**: Specific command or operation
- **Expected Result**: What should happen
- **Verification**: How to confirm success
- **Rollback**: How to clean up if needed

### 2. Error Scenarios
Deliberately test failure conditions:
- Invalid authentication
- Malformed requests
- Resource exhaustion
- Network timeouts
- Concurrent access conflicts

### 3. Performance Baselines
Establish benchmarks for:
- API response times (< 100ms for simple operations)
- Authentication latency (< 500ms)
- Entity creation throughput
- Memory usage patterns
- Disk I/O efficiency

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All authentication flows work correctly
- ✅ CRUD operations complete without errors
- ✅ Temporal queries return accurate results
- ✅ Dashboard loads and displays data
- ✅ RBAC permissions properly enforced

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ API response times under acceptable thresholds
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable under load
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ WAL files properly managed
- ✅ System remains responsive under concurrent load

### Security Requirements
- ✅ Unauthorized access properly blocked
- ✅ Session tokens properly validated
- ✅ Permission inheritance works correctly
- ✅ Sensitive data not exposed in logs
- ✅ SSL/TLS properly configured

## Issue Tracking

### Critical Issues (Block Release)
- Authentication failures
- Data corruption
- Memory leaks
- Security vulnerabilities

### High Priority Issues
- Performance degradation
- UI functionality problems
- API endpoint failures
- Documentation inaccuracies

### Medium Priority Issues
- Minor UI cosmetic issues
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Feature enhancements

## Test Environment

### System Configuration
- **OS**: Linux 6.8.12-9-pve
- **Platform**: linux
- **Working Directory**: /opt/entitydb
- **Service**: EntityDB v2.32.0-dev
- **URL**: https://localhost:8085

### Test Data Strategy
- **Clean State**: Start with fresh database
- **Incremental**: Build test data progressively
- **Realistic**: Use production-like data volumes
- **Cleanup**: Remove test data after each phase
