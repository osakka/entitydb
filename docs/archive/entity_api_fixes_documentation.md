- Fixed entity retrieval to properly handle IDs in responses

### 2. Relationship Storage Implementation

Similar fixes were applied to the relationship storage system:

- Added proper relationship ID handling in relationship maps
- Implemented comprehensive logging to track relationship operations
- Added validation to ensure relationship IDs are correctly maintained
- Fixed relationship retrieval to properly handle IDs in responses

### 3. Entity ID Extraction and Response

Fixed ID handling in entity API endpoints:

- Improved URL path parsing to correctly extract entity IDs
- Added debugging logs to trace ID extraction and processing
- Ensured entity IDs in responses match the requested entity ID
- Fixed the storage ID verification to maintain consistency

### 4. Relationship ID Extraction and Response

Fixed ID handling in relationship API endpoints:

- Improved URL path parsing to correctly extract relationship IDs
- Added debugging logs to trace ID extraction and processing
- Ensured relationship IDs in responses match the requested relationship ID
- Fixed storage ID verification to maintain consistency

### 5. Entity Filtering

Enhanced entity filtering functionality:

- Fixed type filtering to properly check entity types
- Improved tag filtering to handle various tag formats and structures
- Added robust error handling for missing or malformed fields
- Enhanced logging to better track filtering operations

### 6. Relationship Filtering

Enhanced relationship filtering functionality:

- Fixed source filtering to properly match source entity IDs
- Fixed target filtering to properly match target entity IDs
- Fixed type filtering to properly match relationship types
- Added robust error handling for missing or malformed fields

## Updated API Response Format

### Entity Responses

Entities now consistently include their IDs in responses:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {
    "id": "entity_12345",
    "type": "issue",
    "title": "Sample Issue",
    "status": "pending",
    "tags": ["high-priority", "bug"],
    "properties": {
      "priority": "high",
      "estimate": "2h"
    },
    "created_at": "2025-05-11T15:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-05-11T16:45:00Z",
    "created_by": "usr_admin"
  }
}
```

### Relationship Responses

Relationships now consistently include their IDs in responses:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {
    "id": "rel_12345",
    "source_id": "entity_001",
    "target_id": "entity_002",
    "type": "depends_on",
    "properties": {
      "priority": "high"
    },
    "created_at": "2025-05-11T15:30:00Z",
    "created_by": "usr_admin"
  }
}
```

## Improved Error Handling

The API now provides better error handling and feedback:

- Detailed logs for debugging issues
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error conditions
- Descriptive error messages to aid troubleshooting
- Automatic ID correction when discrepancies are detected

## Testing the Fixes

A comprehensive test script has been created to verify all fixes:

```bash
# Run the entity API fixes test script
/opt/entitydb/share/tests/entity/test_entity_fixes.sh
```

This script tests:

1. Entity creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
2. Entity filtering by type, status, and tags
3. Relationship creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
4. Relationship filtering by source, target, and type
5. Error handling for edge cases

## Best Practices for Using the Entity API

### Entity Creation

When creating entities, provide a type and any necessary tags:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"type":"issue","title":"Sample Issue","tags":["high-priority","bug"]}' \
  "http://localhost:8085/api/v1/entities"
```

### Entity Filtering

Use the filtering parameters to find entities:

```bash
# Filter by type
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8085/api/v1/entities/list?type=issue"

# Filter by status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8085/api/v1/entities/list?status=pending"

# Filter by tags
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8085/api/v1/entities/list?tags=high-priority"
```

### Relationship Management

Create and query relationships between entities:

```bash
# Create relationship
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"source_id":"entity_001","target_id":"entity_002","type":"depends_on"}' \
  "http://localhost:8085/api/v1/entity-relationships"

# Query relationships by source
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8085/api/v1/entity-relationships/list?source=entity_001"
```

## Known Limitations

1. **In-Memory Storage**: The current implementation uses in-memory storage, which means data is lost when the server restarts. Future improvements will add persistent storage using SQLite.

2. **No Transaction Support**: Operations are not wrapped in transactions, so multi-step operations are not atomic.

3. **Limited Validation**: The API performs basic validation but may not catch all edge cases.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Implement SQLite persistence for entities and relationships.

2. **Index Optimization**: Add indices for entity types and tags to improve filter performance.

3. **Relationship Validation**: Add validation to ensure that source and target entities exist before creating relationships.

4. **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Expand this documentation with full API reference and examples.

5. **Transaction Support**: Implement proper transaction support for multiple related operations.
