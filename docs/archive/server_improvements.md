# EntityDB Server Improvements

## Static File Serving Enhancements

The EntityDB server has been improved to better serve static files, particularly for the admin interface. The following changes were made:

### 1. Enhanced Path Handling

- Added support for directory paths (paths ending with `/`) by automatically appending `index.html`
- Improved detection of static file paths to include any path under `/admin/`
- Added explicit support for all common file extensions (`.js`, `.css`, `.html`, etc.)

### 2. MIME Type Support

- Added proper MIME type detection based on file extensions:
  - JavaScript files: `application/javascript; charset=utf-8`
  - CSS files: `text/css; charset=utf-8`
  - HTML files: `text/html; charset=utf-8`
  - Images: Various MIME types based on format (PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG)
  - Other file types: Appropriate MIME types

### 3. Logging Improvements

- Enhanced logging to show the MIME type used when serving static files
- Added debug-friendly messages for directory path handling

## Benefits

These improvements ensure:

1. **Better Browser Compatibility**: Files are served with the correct MIME types, preventing issues with content-type mismatches and security restrictions.
2. **Improved Directory Access**: Accessing directory paths like `/admin/` now automatically serves the appropriate index.html file.
3. **Expanded Static File Support**: Any file with a recognized extension is now properly served as a static file.

## Technical Implementation

The changes were made in the server's request handler logic:

1. Modified the path detection criteria to catch all possible static file requests
2. Added MIME type detection based on file extensions
3. Improved directory path handling logic

These changes ensure all static files are properly served to browsers with the correct content types, preventing MIME type mismatch errors that were previously blocking JavaScript files from executing.

## Maintenance Notes

When adding new file types to be served by the static file handler, make sure to:

1. Add the file extension to the static file detection logic
2. Add the appropriate MIME type mapping in the handleStaticFiles function

The updated server code is more robust and should handle a wider variety of static file requests correctly.
