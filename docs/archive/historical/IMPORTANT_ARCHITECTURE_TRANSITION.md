# IMPORTANT: PURE ENTITY ARCHITECTURE NOTICE

## Complete Consolidation to Pure Entity-Based Architecture

As of **May 11, 2025**, the EntityDB platform has fully consolidated to a pure entity-based architecture with a unified API.

**All specialized endpoints have been replaced with a unified entity API.**

## What This Means

1. **All operations go through the entity API**
   - All objects (workspaces, issues, agents) are now handled as entities
   - Legacy specialized endpoints are redirected to the entity API with deprecation notices
   - The system will eventually move to 410 Gone responses for legacy endpoints

2. **Consolidated API structure**
   - Single unified API for all entity operations
   - Relationship-based connections between entities
   - Tag-based classification and filtering
   - Zero direct database access - everything through API

3. **Database schema fully entity-based**
   - All data is stored in entity and entity relationship tables
   - Flexible schema allows for new entity types without database changes
   - All relationships are explicit entity relationships

## Pure Entity API Structure

### Entity API (Primary Interface)
- `GET /api/v1/entities/list` - List entities with filtering
- `GET /api/v1/entities/{id}` - Get entity by ID
- `POST /api/v1/entities` - Create entity
- `PUT /api/v1/entities/{id}` - Update entity
- `DELETE /api/v1/entities/{id}` - Delete entity

### Entity Relationship API
- `GET /api/v1/entity-relationships/list` - List relationships
- `GET /api/v1/entity-relationships/{id}` - Get relationship by ID
- `POST /api/v1/entity-relationships` - Create relationship
- `PUT /api/v1/entity-relationships/{id}` - Update relationship
- `DELETE /api/v1/entity-relationships/{id}` - Delete relationship

### Legacy API Redirection (With Deprecation Notices)
- `/api/v1/direct/workspace/*` - Redirected to entity API with type=workspace
- `/api/v1/direct/issue/*` - Redirected to entity API with type=issue

## Server Implementation

The server has been updated to implement this architecture:

```bash
# Start the pure entity server
./bin/entitydbd.sh start

# Check server status
./bin/entitydbd.sh status
```

Key features:
- API-first design - no direct database access
- JWT authentication for all operations
- Role-based access control for security
- Unified API for all entity operations
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Testing the Pure Entity API

A test script is provided to verify the pure entity implementation:

```bash
# Run the test script
./bin/test_entity_server.sh
```

This script verifies:
1. Entity API operations (create, read, update, delete)
2. Entity relationship operations
3. Legacy API redirection with deprecation notices
4. Authentication and authorization
5. Proper rejection of unauthorized access attempts

## Documentation

For complete details on the pure entity architecture, see:

- `/opt/entitydb/docs/entity_architecture_guide.md` - Complete architecture guide
- `/opt/entitydb/docs/entity_api_reference.md` - API reference documentation
- `/opt/entitydb/docs/entity_relationship_implementation_summary.md` - Relationship documentation

## Zero Tolerance Policy

As directed, we have implemented a **zero tolerance policy** for specialized endpoints and direct database access:

- All operations go through the unified entity API
- Legacy endpoints redirect to the entity API with deprecation notices
- No specialized handlers for different object types
- No direct database access - everything through the API
- Clean architectural design with maximum flexibility

This ensures a clean, unified architecture and prevents fragmentation of the API surface.
