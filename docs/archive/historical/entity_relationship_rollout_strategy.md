# Entity Relationship Rollout Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for gradually rolling out the entity relationship functionality in the EntityDB platform.

## Overview

The entity relationship functionality represents a significant architectural shift from the traditional issue-based model to a more flexible entity-based architecture. To ensure a smooth transition and minimize risk to production systems, we'll implement a phased rollout approach using feature flags.

## Feature Flags

The system uses the following configuration flags to control the entity-relationship functionality:

1. `entity.enabled` - Master switch for all entity-related features
2. `entity.relationships_enabled` - Controls entity relationship functionality
3. `entity.dual_write_enabled` - Controls dual-write mode (write to both issue dependencies and entity relationships)
4. `entity.handler_enabled` - Controls use of entity-based handlers for API endpoints
5. `entity.based_repository_enabled` - Controls use of entity-based repositories

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 1: Development & Testing (Current)

**Duration**: 2 weeks

**Configuration**:
- `entity.enabled = true`
- `entity.relationships_enabled = true`
- `entity.dual_write_enabled = true`
- `entity.handler_enabled = false`
- `entity.based_repository_enabled = false`

**Activities**:
- Complete development of entity relationship functionality
- Run comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Verify backward compatibility with existing issue-based system
- Run migration tools in dry-run mode
- Fix any identified issues

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Migration tools function correctly in dry-run mode

### Phase 2: Limited Production (Read-only)

**Duration**: 1 week

**Configuration**:
- `entity.enabled = true`
- `entity.relationships_enabled = true`
- `entity.dual_write_enabled = true`
- `entity.handler_enabled = true` (but only for GET endpoints)
- `entity.based_repository_enabled = false`

**Activities**:
- Deploy to production with read-only entity endpoints
- Run dual-write mode to populate entity relationships
- Monitor performance and error rates
- Run actual migration for existing dependencies
- Verify data consistency between issue dependencies and entity relationships

**Success Criteria**:
- No production errors
- Data consistency verified
- Performance within acceptable thresholds

### Phase 3: Full Production (Dual-Write)

**Duration**: 2 weeks

**Configuration**:
- `entity.enabled = true`
- `entity.relationships_enabled = true`
- `entity.dual_write_enabled = true`
- `entity.handler_enabled = true` (all endpoints)
- `entity.based_repository_enabled = false`

**Activities**:
- Enable full entity relationship functionality
- Continue dual-write mode to ensure data consistency
- Monitor error rates, performance, and usage metrics
- Fix any issues identified
- Prepare for transition to entity-based repositories

**Success Criteria**:
- Error rates below 0.1%
- Performance within 10% of baseline
- All data operations preserve consistency

### Phase 4: Entity-Based Repository

**Duration**: 1 week

**Configuration**:
- `entity.enabled = true`
- `entity.relationships_enabled = true`
- `entity.dual_write_enabled = true`
- `entity.handler_enabled = true`
- `entity.based_repository_enabled = true`

**Activities**:
- Switch to entity-based repository implementation
- Continue dual-write for safety
- Monitor performance and functionality
- Final validation of entity-based architecture

**Success Criteria**:
- All functionality works correctly
- Performance meets or exceeds baseline
- No data inconsistencies

### Phase 5: Completion

**Duration**: Indefinite

**Configuration**:
- `entity.enabled = true`
- `entity.relationships_enabled = true`
- `entity.dual_write_enabled = false` (optional, based on stability)
- `entity.handler_enabled = true`
- `entity.based_repository_enabled = true`

**Activities**:
- Optionally disable dual-write mode to save resources
- Complete transition to entity-based architecture
- Remove legacy code if appropriate

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete functionality with entity-based architecture
- Stable operation for extended period
- Performance meets or exceeds targets

## Rollback Strategy

At any phase, if critical issues are identified, we'll implement the following rollback plan:

1. Revert configurations to the previous phase
2. Deploy an emergency fix if necessary
3. Analyze the issue and determine if it requires architectural changes
4. Update the rollout plan accordingly

## Monitoring & Metrics

During the rollout, we'll closely monitor:

1. **Error Rates**:
   - API endpoint errors
   - Database operation errors
   - Client operation errors

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Response times for entity endpoints
   - Database query performance
   - Memory and CPU usage

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Mismatches between issue dependencies and entity relationships
   - Validation of migrated data

4. **Usage Metrics**:
   - Number of entity relationship operations
   - Types of relationships being created

## Communication Plan

Before each phase, we'll:

1. Send an announcement to all users
2. Update documentation with new features
3. Provide training materials for new functionality

After each phase, we'll:

1. Share metrics and success criteria results
2. Address any issues or questions
3. Announce the timeline for the next phase

## Validation Checks

For each phase, implement these validation checks:

1. Run automated tests to verify functionality
2. Perform manual testing of key operations
3. Validate data consistency between systems
4. Review logs for any unexpected errors
5. Benchmark performance against baseline metrics

## Contingency Plans

If any phase does not meet the success criteria:

1. Extend the phase for further testing and fixes
2. Consider rolling back to the previous phase
3. Revise the implementation to address issues
4. Update the rollout plan with revised timelines

By following this phased approach, we can safely transition to the entity-based architecture while minimizing risk to production systems.
