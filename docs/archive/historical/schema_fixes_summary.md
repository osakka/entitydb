# Schema Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document consolidates information about the database schema fixes that have been applied to the EntityDB platform. All schema fixes are now fully integrated into the main codebase, and there's no need for separate fix scripts.

## Fixed Issues

The following issues have been addressed and permanently fixed:

1. **Authentication Token Issues**
   - Added `token_type` column to `auth_tokens` table
   - Fixed JWT token generation and validation

2. **Agent Table Column Mismatches**
   - Renamed `last_active` to `last_active_at` for consistency
   - Added required columns: `worker_pool_id`, `expertise`, and `capability_score`
   - Created agent-related tables: `agent_capabilities` and `agent_performance`

3. **Issue Foreign Key Constraints**
   - Fixed foreign key constraint on `created_by` column in `issues` table
   - Ensured the `agent_claude` entry exists as a fallback

4. **Issue Dependencies Schema**
   - Updated issue dependencies table to use composite primary keys
   - Fixed repository methods to work with the actual schema

5. **Workspace ID Handling**
   - Ensured proper prefixing of workspace IDs with "workspace_"
   - Fixed client commands to handle both prefixed and non-prefixed workspace IDs

## Consolidated SQL

All schema fixes have been consolidated into a single SQL script at:
`/opt/entitydb/src/models/sqlite/schema_update_consolidated.sql`

This file should be used when setting up new instances or when a complete schema reset is needed.

## Migration Process

The migration process is now fully automated through:

1. **Database Migration System**:
   - Located in `/opt/entitydb/src/models/sqlite/migration.go`
   - Automatically applies schema updates on server startup
   - Tracks migration versions to prevent duplicate migrations

2. **Fallback Setup**:
   - If needed, a manual fix can be applied using:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/entitydb/src
   go run tests/setup_admin.go
   ```

## Verification Tests

To verify the schema is correct, run the following test suite:

```bash
cd /opt/entitydb/share/tests/api
./run_all_tests.sh
```

This will execute all API tests, which will fail if schema issues are present.

## Deprecated Fix Files

The following fix files are now deprecated and can be safely removed as their functionality has been integrated into the main codebase:

1. `/opt/entitydb/fix_agent_fk.sql` - Integrated into migrations
2. `/opt/entitydb/fix_issue_fk.sql` - Integrated into migrations
3. `/opt/entitydb/workspace_fix.sh` - Functionality integrated into client
4. `/opt/entitydb/bin/test_issue_create` - Tests now use the main API

## Temporary Workaround Scripts

The following scripts were created as temporary workarounds and should be phased out:

1. `/opt/entitydb/bin/check_agent.sh` - Use client agent commands instead
2. `/opt/entitydb/bin/check_session.sh` - Use client session commands instead
3. `/opt/entitydb/bin/rbac_wrapper.sh` - RBAC now fully integrated into API

## Documentation Updates

The official documentation has been updated to reflect these changes. See:

1. `/opt/entitydb/README.md` - Main project README
2. `/opt/entitydb/src/README.md` - Source code README
3. `/opt/entitydb/docs/rbac_implementation.md` - RBAC documentation
