# Client Update Status Report

## Work Completed

1. **Fixed Server Configuration Issue:**
   - Modified server host from `build.uk.home.arpa` to `localhost` to allow proper binding
   - Server now successfully starts and runs on port 8085

2. **Fixed Client Command Structure:**
   - Updated main.go to properly handle client commands and subcommands
   - Integrated WORKER_ID environment variable into the client
   - Added proper help system for all client commands
   - Updated command flags and parameters to match documentation

3. **Updated Client Wrapper Script:**
   - Fixed entitydbc.sh to properly pass commands to the entitydb binary
   - Configured proper server URL and connection parameters

## Known Issues / Next Steps

1. **Command Implementation:**
   - Client framework is in place but actual command implementations are not connected
   - The API layer has command implementations in the codebase but they're not wired up to the main client interface
   - Need to incorporate the existing agent, session, task, and project commands from src/client/commands/

2. **Mock Data and Testing:**
   - Need to create sample data for testing client functionality
   - Web dashboard shows simulated data, but client needs to connect to actual backend

## Implementation Plan

1. Wire up the command handlers in main.go to the actual command handlers in client/commands/
2. Add proper error handling and feedback for client operations
3. Test each command with mock data
4. Ensure client properly communicates with the server API

## Command Structure Implemented

The client now supports this command structure:

```
entitydb client [options] <command> <subcommand> [args]

Commands:
  agent                 Manage agents
  session               Manage sessions
  task                  Manage tasks 
  project               Manage projects
  help [command]        Show help for a specific command
```

Each command supports the appropriate subcommands as documented in CLAUDE.md.
