# EntityDB Platform: Current State and Progress

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the EntityDB (EntityDB) platform, outlining all implemented components, architectural decisions, and recent enhancements.

## Executive Summary

The EntityDB platform is now fully operational with all core components implemented according to the pure entity-based architecture. The platform provides comprehensive functionality for managing AI agents, tasks, and workflows through a unified entity API. Recent enhancements have significantly improved the security posture of the platform.

Key achievements:
- Full implementation of the pure entity-based architecture
- Comprehensive entity relationship system
- Unified entity API with support for legacy endpoints
- Enhanced security with input validation, audit logging, and RBAC
- Complete command-line interface for all operations

## Core Architecture

The EntityDB platform is built on a pure entity-based architecture with the following core principles:

1. **Pure Entity Model**:
   - ALL objects represented as entities with tags
   - Entity relationships for connections between objects
   - No specialized tables or data structures

2. **API-First Design**:
   - ALL operations go through the entity API
   - ZERO direct database access
   - JWT-based authentication for all operations

3. **Legacy Compatibility**:
   - Legacy endpoints redirect to entity API
   - Deprecation notices in all legacy responses
   - No new specialized endpoints
