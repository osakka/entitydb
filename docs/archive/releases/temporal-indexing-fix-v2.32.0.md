# Temporal Indexing Race Condition Fix (v2.32.0-dev)

## Problem Summary

EntityDB was experiencing a critical race condition in temporal tag indexing where newly created entities (particularly sessions) were indexed correctly in the sharded index but not immediately searchable via `ListByTag` operations. This caused authentication failures with "Invalid or expired token" errors even for freshly created sessions.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `ListByTag` implementation in `/opt/entitydb/src/storage/binary/entity_repository.go`:

1. **Entity Creation Flow**: When entities are created, they are:
   - Added to memory cache immediately
   - Indexed in the sharded tag index immediately
   - Persisted to disk asynchronously via WAL checkpointing

2. **Reader Pool Issue**: `ListByTag` used a reader pool (lines 1908-1922) where pooled readers might have been created before recent WAL checkpoints, causing them to miss newly persisted entities even though:
   - The sharded index correctly found the entity IDs
   - The entities existed in memory cache

3. **Race Condition**: The sequence was:
   ```
   1. Create session entity → indexed in sharded index
   2. ListByTag finds entity ID in sharded index
   3. fetchEntitiesWithReader uses pooled reader
   4. Pooled reader was created before WAL checkpoint
   5. Reader doesn't see the entity on disk
   6. Memory cache check was added but reader pool remained stale
   ```

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed ListByTag Method

**File**: `/opt/entitydb/src/storage/binary/entity_repository.go` (lines 1907-1919)

**Before**:
```go
// Get a reader from the pool
readerInterface := r.readerPool.Get()
if readerInterface == nil {
    // Create new reader
} else {
    // Use pooled reader (PROBLEMATIC)
}
```

**After**:
```go
// CRITICAL FIX: Always create a fresh reader to avoid stale reader pool issues
// The reader pool can contain readers created before recent WAL checkpoints,
// causing them to miss newly persisted entities even though the sharded index
// correctly finds them. This ensures we always have a current view of the data.
logger.Trace("Creating fresh reader for ListByTag to avoid stale pool readers")
reader, err := NewReader(r.getDataFile())
if err != nil {
    logger.Error("Failed to create reader: %v", err)
    return nil, err
}
defer reader.Close()
```

### Supporting Fix in fetchEntitiesWithReader

**File**: `/opt/entitydb/src/storage/binary/entity_repository.go` (lines 1955-1977)

The `fetchEntitiesWithReader` method was already enhanced to check memory cache first before disk access:

```go
// CRITICAL FIX: Check memory first before reading from disk
// This fixes the race condition where newly created entities are indexed 
// but not yet persisted to disk
entities := make([]*models.Entity, 0, len(entityIDs))
remainingIDs := make([]string, 0, len(entityIDs))

// First pass: check memory cache for all entities
r.mu.RLock()
for _, id := range entityIDs {
    if entity, exists := r.entities[id]; exists {
        entities = append(entities, entity)
        logger.Debug("fetchEntitiesWithReader: Found in memory cache: %s", id)
    } else {
        remainingIDs = append(remainingIDs, id)
    }
}
r.mu.RUnlock()
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- Sessions created successfully but not immediately findable
- `ValidateSession` required multiple retry attempts (5 attempts with 50ms delays)
- Frequent "401 detected, session may be expired" errors in admin console
- Metrics entities and other newly created entities showed similar issues

### After Fix
- Session validation works on first attempt consistently
- Login → token validation → protected endpoint access works seamlessly
- Logs show: `ValidateSession: Found 1 session entities on attempt 1`
- All temporal indexing race conditions eliminated

## Performance Impact

### Positive
- **Eliminated Authentication Delays**: No more retry loops for session validation
- **Consistent Performance**: Predictable authentication response times
- **Memory Cache Benefits**: Still leverages memory cache for non-persisted entities

### Trade-offs
- **Reader Creation Overhead**: Creates fresh readers instead of reusing pooled ones
- **Justified Cost**: The reliability gain far outweighs the minor performance cost
- **Alternative Considered**: Reader pool invalidation was more complex and error-prone

   - `ListByTag()` method (lines 1831-1947)
   - `fetchEntitiesWithReader()` method (lines 1949-2050)

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:

1. **Login Test**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8085/api/v1/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'
   ```

2. **Immediate Token Usage**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     https://localhost:8085/api/v1/dashboard/stats
   ```

3. **Log Verification**: Check for `Found 1 session entities on attempt 1` in logs

## Future Considerations

1. **Reader Pool Optimization**: Could implement intelligent reader pool invalidation
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track reader creation frequency vs pool hit rates
3. **Alternative Caching**: Consider entity-level caching strategies
