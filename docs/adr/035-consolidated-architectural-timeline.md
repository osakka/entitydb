# ADR-035: Consolidated Architectural Timeline

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-20  
**Authors**: EntityDB Architecture Team  
**Related**: ADR-020 (Comprehensive Timeline)

## Context

This ADR consolidates the architectural decision timeline from the root-level `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_TIMELINE.md` into the ADR documentation structure. This eliminates duplication and provides a single source of truth for architectural decision tracking with accurate dates from git commits.

## Decision

Consolidate all architectural timeline information into the ADR documentation structure and update all dates to reflect actual git commit dates rather than placeholder dates (0001-01-01).

## Problem Addressed

The original root-level timeline contained many placeholder dates (0001-01-01) and was duplicated with information in the ADR directory. This consolidation:

1. **Eliminates Duplication**: Single source of truth for timeline information
2. **Corrects Dates**: Updates placeholder dates with actual git commit dates  
3. **Improves Organization**: All ADR information in one location
4. **Enhances Traceability**: Direct links to git commits for verification
