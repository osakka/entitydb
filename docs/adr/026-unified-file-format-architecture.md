# ADR-026: Unified File Format Architecture

**Status:** Implemented  
**Date:** 2025-06-20  
**Deciders:** EntityDB Core Team  
**Technical Lead:** Claude AI Assistant  

## Context

EntityDB previously used a three-file architecture:
- `.db` file: Main database content
- `.ebf` file: EntityDB Binary Format header 
- `.wal` file: Write-Ahead Log for durability

This approach created file handle complexity, increased system resource usage, and complicated atomic operations across multiple files.

## Decision

Implement a **Unified EntityDB File Format (EUFF)** that consolidates all three files into a single unified file with embedded sections.

### Technical Specifications

#### Unified File Format (EUFF)
- **Magic Number:** `0x45555446` ("EUFF")
- **Format Version:** `2`
- **Header Size:** `128 bytes`
- **Section-Based Organization:** WAL, Data, Tag Dictionary, Entity Index

#### Unified Header Structure
```go
type UnifiedHeader struct {
    Magic              uint32   // 0x45555446 ("EUFF")
    Version            uint32   // Format version (2)
    FileSize           uint64   // Total file size
    WALOffset          uint64   // WAL section offset
    WALSize            uint64   // WAL section size
    DataOffset         uint64   // Data section offset 
    DataSize           uint64   // Data section size
    TagDictOffset      uint64   // Tag dictionary offset
    TagDictSize        uint64   // Tag dictionary size
    EntityIndexOffset  uint64   // Entity index offset
    EntityIndexSize    uint64   // Entity index size
    EntityCount        uint64   // Total entities
    LastModified       int64    // Last modification timestamp
    WALSequence        uint64   // WAL sequence number
    CheckpointSequence uint64   // Checkpoint sequence
    Reserved           [16]byte // Reserved for future use
}
```

### Implementation Architecture

#### Core Components
1. **Format Detection:** Automatic detection between unified (EUFF) and legacy (EBF) formats
2. **Unified Writer:** `NewUnifiedWriter()` with embedded WAL support
3. **Unified Reader:** `NewUnifiedReader()` with backward compatibility  
4. **Section-Based WAL:** WAL operations within unified file sections
5. **Repository Integration:** `NewUnifiedRepositoryWithConfig()` for unified format usage

#### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy EBF format remains fully supported
- Automatic format detection in readers
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Gradual migration path available

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `format.go`: Added unified header structures and format detection
- `writer.go`: Implemented unified writer with embedded WAL
- `reader.go`: Added unified reader with format detection
- `wal.go`: Enhanced WAL for section-based operations
- `entity_repository.go`: Added unified repository configuration
- `config.go`: Added unified filename configuration

### Key Features
- **Single File Architecture:** Eliminates file handle complexity
- **Atomic Operations:** All operations within single file boundary
- **Format Detection:** Automatic detection and handling of both formats
- **Section Organization:** Logical separation within unified structure
- **Zero Regressions:** Full backward compatibility maintained

## Benefits

### Operational Benefits
- **Reduced File Handle Usage:** Single file instead of 3 separate files
- **Simplified Atomic Operations:** All operations within one file boundary
- **Improved Performance:** Reduced I/O overhead and system calls
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Simplified failure scenarios and recovery

### Architectural Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth:** Unified file eliminates synchronization issues
- **Cleaner Architecture:** Simplified file management and operations
- **Better Resource Utilization:** Reduced system resource consumption
- **Future-Proof Design:** Extensible section-based architecture

### Maintenance Benefits
- **Simplified Deployment:** Single file for backup/restore operations
- **Easier Debugging:** Single file to analyze for issues
- **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer moving parts in file management
- **Clear Migration Path:** Gradual adoption without breaking changes

## Testing and Validation

### Core Testing Completed
- ✅ Unified writer functionality validation
- ✅ Unified file creation and structure verification  
- ✅ Format detection for both unified and legacy formats
- ✅ Unified reader initialization and operation
- ✅ Legacy format compatibility preservation
- ✅ Build system integration and zero regressions

### Test Results
- **Unified File Creation:** Successfully creates EUFF format files
- **Format Detection:** Correctly identifies unified vs legacy formats  
- **Reader/Writer Integration:** Full read/write cycle functionality
- **Legacy Compatibility:** Existing EBF files continue to work
- **Zero Regression:** All existing functionality preserved

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
ENTITYDB_UNIFIED_FILE="/var/lib/entitydb/entities.unified"
```

### Usage
```go
// Create unified repository
repo, err := binary.NewUnifiedRepositoryWithConfig(cfg)

// Create unified writer  
writer, err := binary.NewUnifiedWriter(filename)

// Create unified reader
reader, err := binary.NewUnifiedReader(filename)
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation (Complete)
- Core unified format implementation
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Testing and validation

### Phase 2: Optional Enhancements
- Full repository integration for maximum performance
- Production configuration flags
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Future Migration
- Gradual migration from legacy to unified format
- Tooling for format conversion
- Production deployment strategies

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: File Corruption Impact
- **Mitigation:** Single file corruption vs multiple file corruption scenarios are comparable
- **Mitigation:** WAL-based recovery mechanisms remain intact
- **Mitigation:** Backup strategies adapted for single file

### Risk: Large File Handling
- **Mitigation:** Memory-mapped file access handles large files efficiently
- **Mitigation:** Section-based organization enables partial file operations
- **Mitigation:** OS-level file system optimizations apply

### Risk: Migration Complexity
