## Implementation Order

1. **First**: Action 1 (Operation IDs) - Foundation for tracking
2. **Second**: Actions 2-3 (Logging) - Visibility into operations
3. **Third**: Action 4 (Fix Index) - Address immediate issue
4. **Fourth**: Action 6 (Verification) - Detect problems
5. **Fifth**: Actions 7-8 (Checksums) - Prevent corruption
6. **Sixth**: Action 9 (Recovery) - Fix existing issues
7. **Last**: Action 10 (Monitoring) - Ongoing health

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- Test operation ID generation
- Test checksum calculation
- Test index operations
- Test recovery mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- Test full write/read cycle
- Test corruption detection
- Test recovery procedures
- Test monitoring accuracy

### Stress Tests
- Concurrent operations
- Large data volumes
- Corruption injection
- Recovery under load

## Definition of Done

Each action is complete when:
1. Code implemented and reviewed
2. Unit tests written and passing
3. Integration tests passing
4. Documentation updated
5. Logging verified in test environment
6. No regressions in existing functionality

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Performance Impact
- **Mitigation**: Async logging, benchmarking
- **Monitoring**: Track operation latencies

### Risk 2: Breaking Changes
- **Mitigation**: Feature flags, gradual rollout
- **Monitoring**: Error rates, compatibility tests

### Risk 3: Storage Growth
- **Mitigation**: Log rotation, compression
- **Monitoring**: Disk usage metrics

## Communication Plan

### Daily Updates
- Progress on current actions
- Blockers identified
- Next actions planned
- Test results

### Phase Completion
- Summary of changes
- Test results
- Performance impact
- Next phase plan

## Success Metrics

1. **Corruption Detection**: 100% of corruptions detected
2. **Recovery Success**: 95%+ successful recoveries
3. **Performance Impact**: <5% latency increase
4. **Logging Coverage**: 100% of data operations logged
5. **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage

## Next Immediate Step

Action 6: Create Integrity Check Tool

Now that we have comprehensive logging and fixed the index write operations, we need to build a verification tool to:
- Check index completeness
- Verify all entities are readable
- Report any inconsistencies
- Generate detailed integrity reports

## Progress Summary
