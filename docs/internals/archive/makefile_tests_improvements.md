# Makefile and Tests Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes improvements made to the EntityDB build system and test structure. Recent updates include enhancements to support the entity-based architecture testing.

## Changes Made

### Makefile Improvements

1. **Fix paths for test utilities**
   - Updated path references from `/src/tests/` to `/src/tools/`
   - Updated test utility documentation to reflect the new path structure

2. **Improved error handling**
   - API tests now properly fail the build when they fail
   - Made error messages more informative
   - Fixed command structure for better error propagation

3. **Simplified test targets**
   - Removed redundant master-tests dependency on individual test targets
   - Made test flow more straightforward

4. **Entity Test Support**
   - Added `entity-tests` target for running entity-based architecture tests
   - Added color-coded output for entity tests
   - Implemented proper error handling for entity test failures
   - Added `master-entity-tests` for comprehensive entity test runs

### Script Improvements

1. **Enhanced `run_api_tests.sh`**
   - Added server availability check before running tests
   - Added proper error handling and status reporting
   - Improved output formatting with color coding
   - Added helpful error messages when server is not running
   - Added support for entity tests with specific reporting

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README.md with clear instructions for test targets
   - Updated tools README.md with proper paths and commands
   - Added testing notes to clarify requirements

3. **Entity Test Scripts**
   - Created dedicated test scripts for entity-based architecture
   - Added `test_entity_api.sh` for basic entity API testing
   - Added `test_entity_issue_compatibility.sh` for testing backward compatibility
   - Added `test_entity_tags.sh` for testing tag-based operations
   - Created a shared `test_utils.sh` for entity tests with helper functions

### Source Code Fixes

1. **Fixed build errors in `routes.go`**
   - Removed references to deprecated `issueRepo`
   - Added proper SQLite database connection setup for tag-based features
   - Fixed error handling and logging

2. **Entity-Related Improvements**
   - Implemented `GetContentByType` method for Entity model
   - Fixed tag search functionality in EntityRepository
   - Added mock entity generation for tests
   - Enhanced error handling in entity-related endpoints

## Testing Process

After making these changes, the following test commands should now work correctly:

```bash
# Build the project
cd /opt/entitydb/src && make clean && make

# Run unit tests
cd /opt/entitydb/src && make unit-tests

# Run API tests (server must be running)
/opt/entitydb/bin/entitydbd.sh start  # Start the server if not running
cd /opt/entitydb/src && make api-tests

# Run entity tests
cd /opt/entitydb/src && make entity-tests

# Run all entity tests with detailed reporting
cd /opt/entitydb/src && make master-entity-tests

# Run all tests
cd /opt/entitydb/src && make test
```

## Usage Notes

- The API tests require the server to be running at http://localhost:8085
- Unit tests run independently and don't require the server
- The `master-tests` target will run all tests regardless of failures (useful for development)
- The `test` target will stop if any test fails (useful for CI/CD)
- Entity tests verify the tag-based entity architecture
- The `entity-tests` target will run all entity tests and report a summary
- The `master-entity-tests` target provides more detailed reporting for entity tests
