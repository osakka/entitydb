# EntityDB Performance Analysis Summary

## Current State
The server is experiencing significant performance issues:
- **Average request time**: 1.3 seconds (should be <50ms)
- **Concurrent performance**: Severe degradation under load
- **Health check**: 2.2 seconds (should be <5ms)

## Configuration
```
ENTITYDB_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=true  âœ“
ENTITYDB_WAL_ONLY=false
ENTITYDB_DATASPACE=false
SSL enabled on port 8085
```

## Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Repository Implementation**: Even with HIGH_PERFORMANCE=true, the TemporalRepository appears to have performance issues
2. **Index Loading**: 17,296 tags being loaded, possibly on each request
3. **Lock Contention**: Concurrent requests show 10x performance degradation
4. **SSL Overhead**: Adds ~8ms per request

## Quick Wins Available

1. **Optimize Health Check**: Remove database query from health endpoint
2. **Add Caching Layer**: Implement request-level caching for entities
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse file handles and connections
4. **Disable SSL for Internal**: Use HTTP for better performance

## Recommendation

The performance issues stem from the core repository implementation. While we've added features like dataspace management and improved the API, the underlying storage layer needs optimization. Consider:

1. Implementing a proper caching layer
2. Using connection pooling for file access
3. Moving to a more efficient storage backend (Redis, PostgreSQL)
4. Profiling the code to identify exact bottlenecks

The current implementation works functionally but needs performance tuning for production use.
