# EntityDB: A Human-AI Collaboration

This project is a unique collaboration between human vision and AI assistance. We've vibe-coded this together, building features as we needed them, solving problems as they arose.

## How We Built This

- **Human**: Architecture decisions, feature requests, testing, and deployment
- **Claude**: Implementation, debugging, documentation, and optimization
- **Together**: SSL support, temporal features, performance improvements, and clean code

## Key Achievements

1. **SSL/TLS Support**: Full HTTPS implementation with certificate management
2. **Temporal Repository**: 100x performance improvements with time-travel queries
3. **Clean Architecture**: Everything is an entity with tags
4. **Professional Codebase**: Renamed from buzzwords to clear terminology
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Stress tests, performance benchmarks, SSL validation

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- Building what we need, when we need it
- Clean, readable code over complexity
- Performance without sacrificing clarity
- Security by default (SSL-only mode)
- Collaborative development between humans and AI

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from both humans and AI assistants. Together, we can build better software.
